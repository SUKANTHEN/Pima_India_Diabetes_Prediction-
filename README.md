# Pima_India_Diabetes_Prediction-

 This is a predictive analysis project on predicting DIABETES amoung women of particular area. The diabetes occurence depends on many paramters like Glucose, Pressure, Skin Thickness etc. We are going to use different Machine Learning algorithms and check for the best accuracies among them.
 Presence of Diabetes is valued to 1 while being normal represents the binary value 0. 
 
The models are built using Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier and the next model is built using AutoML technique called TPOT that predicted XGBoost to give the best accuracy.
